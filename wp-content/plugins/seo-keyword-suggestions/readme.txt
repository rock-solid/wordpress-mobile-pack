Drive targeted search visitors to your website by focusing on the most promising organic keywords in your existing traffic.

== Description ==

HitTail is an [SEO keyword tool](http://www.hittail.com/) 
that tells you, in real-time, the most promising search terms you should 
target based on your existing traffic. We do this using a sophisticated 
algorithm tuned by analyzing over 1.2 billion keywords.

As a website owner, one of your biggest assets is the proprietary data 
contained in your web traffic, since your competition does not have access 
to it. HitTail analyzes your visitor stream in real-time and provides you with a 
simple, actionable list of SEO keyword suggestions you should be targeting 
to dramatically grow your organic search traffic.

= The HitTailing Process =

Simply [sign up for a HitTail account](http://www.hittail.com/plans.asp)
and install this plugin to get started. Once installed, we begin to analyze all 
your traffic to find the most promising keyword suggestions for your website.

If you target the [keyword suggestions](http://www.hittail.com/faq/write.html) 
provided by HitTail in just one article or blog post, you are almost 
guaranteed to rank on the first page for those keywords. As you 
continue adding content and increasing your keyword diversity, the size 
and rankings of your site effectively _snowball_. That is the power of
long tail SEO.
